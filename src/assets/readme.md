# Canonn Signals

Canonn Signals is a comprehensive Elite Dangerous system analysis tool that displays detailed astronomical data for stellar systems.

It features signal display across five categories (Human, Other, Geology, Biology, Thargoid, and Guardian) with predictive capabilities for biological signals. 

The application performs advanced astronomical calculations including Roche limit analysis with interactive visualizations, Hill sphere calculations, orbital mechanics (periapsis/apoapsis predictions), and spin-orbit resonance detection. 

It identifies rare phenomena like Trojan configurations and Klemperer rosettes, provides detailed mining resource analysis with visual categorization (gemstones, metals, minerals, fuel), and offers landing safety assessments with color-coded warnings. 

Bodies are displayed in a hierarchical tree structure with comprehensive physical properties, composition breakdowns, and educational dialogs explaining complex astronomical concepts. 

The interface integrates real-time data from Spansh API and the Galactic Exploration Catalog and Canonn, presenting it through Material Design components with smart auto-expansion, tooltips throughout, and JSON export capabilities for detailed system analysis.
